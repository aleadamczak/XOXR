## Personal reflection 

Let me start by saying I was looking forward to this course since the first semester, and it did not dissapoint.

I think I was really lucky with my group, I didn't know Ola before and I had been in GMD course with Laura but we hadn't work toguether, so I really didn't know what to expect but I was happily surprised. They were both responsible, invested in the project and skilled programmers, and on top of that there were just nice people and fun to be around. We found a nice balance between working toguether and keeping each other updated and working individually in each of our tasks.  10 out of 10.

My brain is fried from the bachelor and I have been trying to write the next paragraph for half an hour so i will just try again tomorrow :)
