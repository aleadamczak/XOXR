## Personal reflection: Rosa

Let me start by saying I was looking forward to this course since the first semester, and it did not dissapoint.

I think I was really lucky with my group, I didn't know Ola before and I had been in GMD course with Laura but we hadn't work toguether, so I really didn't know what to expect but I was happily surprised. They were both responsible, invested in the project and skilled programmers, and on top of that there were just nice people and fun to be around. We found a nice balance between working toguether and keeping each other updated and working individually in each of our tasks.  10 out of 10.

If you have read the devblogs you already know which parts of the projects I was responsible of, but let me do a quick recap anyways:

In the AR project:
- I worked in the initialization of the game play by placing the first two sheeps
- I created the bars on top of the animals, first for hunger and thirst and later with the pregnancy period as well.
- Along with the bars, I also added the functionality for the animals getting hungry and thirsty, and dying when their bars reached 0.
- When we still didn't have the UI so you couldn't select the food, I implemented that you could feed the animals by touching them.
- I implemented that animals could get pregnant and have babies. I made sure that only happy animals could have babies. A animal is happy if both their hunger and thirst bars are over the half of their capacity.
- I created a game over screen for displaying the score of the player once all the animals died, that also allows the player to restart the game.
- Similarily, I created a game instructions screen for when you start the game.

In the VR project:
- I created the ingredient models: some I found in the store, others I had to create them in blender
- I also created the pizza dough model, with the animation to transform it from a ball of dough into a pizza shape, which I also did in blender. I also created 4 different textures for the rolled dough: plaon dough, dough with tomato, dough with cheese, and dough with tomato and cheese.
- Now in unity, I created the assembly station. I started with placing all of the ingredients in bowls, putting a table with 4 balls of dough that regenerate when you use all of them, and added a rolling pin model to roll the dough, and a spoon to get the sauce.
- I created the functionality of using the rolling pin to roll the dough
- I created the functionality for using the spoon to add the sauce to the pizza
- I created the functionality of adding all of the ingredients to the pizza and storing in which quarters they are.
- I got a person prefab from the store and modified it to get 4 different customers
- I fix the customer movement to ensure that they were facing where they shouls, and using the proper walking and stopping animations.

Both of the projects turned out really good, but of course there is room for improvement in both so I want to discuss a little bit the tricky parts, thing that I thing could have been done different, and also of course the parts that I think worked best and I am most proud of.

# AR project: 

Here the main problem for me was that we were working all in different scenes and left putting everything toguether for the end. We ended up with a messy code that was working, but the naming was hard to understand and there were parts that were repeated or not doing anything anymore. Of course we were just begginning to work as a group and it took us a while to get used to the coding style of the others. I must say that I am surprise of how much we improved in this sense for the VR project, and that i prove of how much we have learned in a single semester. 

At the begginning when we decided what we wanted to do for the projejct, we included stuff like fences to enclose the animal, selling to a farmer that would ask you for specific products, having a wolf that would eat your animals if you didn't put the fence, or parents getting sad if you kill their babies. Of course we knew that it was ambitious, so I think one of the best decitions we took was to make the prioritized list from were we took our tasks. It made it feel more like a real project, and even though we didn't include all of the functionality we ended up with a nice and playable game, which I don't think would have happen otherwise.

The biggest learning outcome from this project was not so much related to unity or even AR development (even though of course I learned about both), I think it was being able to work toguether, from the planning stage to the development and testing, and it definetily allowed us to create an amazing VR project.
For me, it even felt like it took us way more time and effort for a final product that was not nearly as complicated as the VR one, but that might be due to the time invested in setting up unity version control or the fact that we had the break in the middle.

Lastly, I must say that I would have enjoyed if we could have included more AR specific functionality. A project involving face or image tracking, or even projection mapping would have been cool, but the project we did felt more like a game development project than a AR one. It is also because in the tasks where I was involved the only AR specifics were touching the animals and restating the scene correctly, the rest was mostly game development in a AR environment. Luckily we know have the tools to explore those options by ourselves.

# VR project:

The main and almost only problem in this project was our laptops. None of us had a good enough grapic card to use Meta Quest Link, whihc means that we were stucked with using the simulator throughout the project. It really sucked. Then we also had problems building directly to the headset, and we were still stuggling even the day before the expo. We finally managed to make it work, but it was stressfull nonetheless.

However, that ends all the bad things I have to say about this project, I think the progress from AR to VR amazing for all of the members of the group. Every complain I could have about code being messy of difficult to merge... gone! For real this project felt amazing to do because at every point even if I hadn't work in parts of the projects I could read the code and understand it perfectly, and it was also so easy to extend with my new functionality! Even though we were scared about what would happen when we passed the pizza object from station to station, it was working perfectly, and the game ended up being cohesive and super fun to play.

From my part, the biggest challenge was the fact that the ingredients were making the pizza shake a lot. I managed to mitigate to some degree, and now in the end result they are only shaking a little. Still to this day I don't completely understand why this is happening, but well sometimes it do be like that :) The rest of the development was not complicated, it only required time and a little bit of trial and error, but I ended up with results I liked in all of the rest of the functionality I created. My favourite parts were adding the pizza sauce and grabbing infinite ingredients from the bowls :)

Unlike with the AR project, in this one I felt like was learning new things about VR in every step of the way, so that was also an improvement in that sense. Moreover, I was happy we had the blender workshop, and I got to use what we learnt in the project. The mushroom and olive models ended up looking exactly how I wanted them to look. At the begginnig I wasn't sure how to create the rolling the pizza dough animation and I couldn't find any tutorial. I think using one for a bouncing ball was a smart solution and I only needed to adapt it a bit for my animation. 

Overall this project was amazing to create and it was a nice conclusion to the course, specially since everybody who played in the expo and before that loved it!

## Conclusion

To sum up, and as I already said at the beggining, the course fulfilled all of my expectations, which I promise were not low at all! It was fun, I learned a lot both from a technical point of view and about team work, and it had an amazing conclusion which was the expo. I loved seeing the projects frome everybody, a lot of them were extremely cool and you could easily see how invested everyone was. I think that alone is prove of how well the course works! 

That concludes my personal refelction, hope you enjoyed it :)
