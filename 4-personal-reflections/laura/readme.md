## XRD Personal Reflection: Laura

Hey there! This is Laura and I’ll be reflecting on my experience learning about AR and VR technologies in the XRD course at VIA. You know I’m bad at keeping it short, so I’ve added a summary at the top if you don’t feel like reading the whole thing xd. Otherwise, feel free to stick around! :)

### Learning Outcome Summary
- **Teamwork and Collaboration:** Despite my reluctancy, I transitioned from solo to team-based work: going from a more “bulk productivity” approach to a “consistent effort & slow progress” one (challenging for me, but required in a team setting).
- **Modular Approach, Code Extendability, Progress Tracking:** Made some of the most extendable code I’ve ever written due to being in a group, and felt first-hand the benefits of writing down our requirements and keeping track of what’s done! We were really consistent with our progress.
- **Technical Skills:** Got even better at Unity development and learned what it takes to develop (AND TEST!) AR and VR projects. Testing in VR needs to be more frequent…! I experienced the consequences of delaying that task… Also these were my first projects in 3D :D! But it was super tranquil with my GMD background.
- **General Reflections:** The course introduced me to immersive technologies and I’m glad I got to work with high-end equipment and also see at the expo what everyone else made! :D It was awesome.

That’s the general picture - and if you wanna know the whole story, here it goes :).

## Team Formation
At first, I was really reticent about working in a team because I worked alone for GMD last semester and that worked out really well - I had basically postponed most of my development to the last two weeks before the deadline because I am terrible at shifting focus, so I would rather do things “intensively in bulk” rather than in small, consistent efforts… and I knew that, the second scenario is what is expected in a group. To make matters worse, all of my courses this semester were project-based, which, regrettably for me, would mean a lot of shifting focus. 

Still, I was discouraged by the teacher to work alone because of the limited number of headsets at the Expo, so I decided to stop being a snowflake and team up.

I formed a group with Ola (from one semester below, and who I knew as a friend) and Rosa, who I was not very close with but knew she took GMD as well and made a really cool project! I remember going into the first class feeling anxious as hell and leaving super relieved due to getting into a group with two girls - because now even if the process were to be challenging, at least it would be fun and girly :).

## Idea Choice
### AR Project - fARm
**(AR Minecraft Farm Animals)**

If I remember correctly, the Minecraft Farm Animals idea came from me, for three reasons:
- Low poly and pixelated graphics are super performant
- I love Minecraft
- Virtually everyone (in software circles xd) knows and likes Minecraft
- I was 99% sure we were gonna be able to find the assets for the animals online) (which we did, and they were rigged!)
So I was super glad that the girls agreed on the idea and we could go forward with it :).

### VR Project - Mama’s Pizzeria
**(VR Pizzeria inspired in Papa’s Pizzeria)**

I don’t remember who brought up the Pizzeria idea but I do remember being hooked on it straight away! One of the most fun parts was when we all sat in a line playing the browser game Papa’s Pizzeria getting inspiration for the concept of our VR game ahah :)) - from just a short play sesh we knew that game had the perfect structure for this project: it was very modular, so each person could actually focus on a different station of the pizza cooking process and we could separately make progress without blocking each other! This was particularly relevant when we only had three (?) weeks to make the project - no time to waste!

## Design Phase
Design phase is a fancy word for it lol, but for both projects we had to sit down and make lists with our requirements and drawings with how we imagined things would look like. This was something we learned in general from studying software at VIA and I would argue it helped us define the scope, align our ideas, see the bigger picture, and track progress more easily as we moved forward. I really think we owe our steady progress to our good planning phase.

## Version Control
Setting up Unity Version Control was a nightmare, but in the end we got it! The funny part is I exhausted all my “organization seats” for this group and then I had none left for my bachelor’s project, which was also in Unity lol. But in the end that meant I got to learn both ways of version control for Unity, so maybe it was a curse in disguise! And that’s another thing I would have missed out on if I worked alone.

## Individual Development
Our tasks were always really well separated (again thanks to our good planning ;)) and, at least for me, the individual development went very smoothly! On Tuesdays we would meet up and discuss what we had done and what was in store for the next week, so I always knew what I had to do and could always accomplish lots in one session and stay on track with my tasks :). In this project, I EXTENSIVELY utilized the knowledge I acquired in GMD. It served as a really good base for XRD. To be honest, there was nothing in development that was challenging for me other than what was new: the AR/VR specifics. (More on that later.) I was glad to be someone reliable in the team and I can confidently say I contributed lots to our projects with my previous knowledge and expertise eheheh.

## Collaborative Development
Most of our development hours were spent “in isolation”, so we didn’t really sit together in a room coding per se, BUT when going through my teammates’ code it really showed that they put in the effort to make it extendable! I mean, some of it had me scratching my head, but it was pretty good for the most part. And this was also one of the projects where I felt the most motivation to make really extendable code - because other people would actually have to read it and elaborate on it - and I think I did a great job! I would argue that I did even better than for my GMD project, so that was another great learning takeaway from being in a group :).

## Finishing Touches
One thing we could have done better would be making a folder structure from the get-go: by the time our projects were finished, we had a ton of Scenes (even though only one was relevant lol) and our Scripts were basically all in one big folder. I took ownership of restructuring the code and made it look better for hand-in. But to be honest, the lack of a structure didn’t really interfere with development… I guess because it was only a couple three-week projects - if they were bigger, I can see how it would soon become troublesome. But - lesson learned! I never had to do it before, so it didn’t cross my mind until it was already too late.

I was also responsible for setting up audio for both projects, and the truth is I always did it in the last week before our “deadline” because we simply disregarded audio throughout development lol. And now that I think about it, I did the same with GMD… But I also wouldn’t call that necessarily bad! It was really easy to add it at the end. I would never hand in a game development project without audio - even the smallest touches make a huge difference in the “feedback” that the player gets from his in-game actions. So that was fine. :D

## Testing
If someone asks me what was the most challenging part about developing for AR, and particularly VR, I will scream “TESTING”. AR was fine because the simulator did basically the same thing as the phone, but VR was a struggle for two reasons: one, I don’t own a VR headset and I didn’t set foot in VIA that much this semester, therein limiting my testing opportunities, and two: I am a Mac user… and no one told me that VR would be so incompatible with it! The Meta Quest Link app did not even exist for Mac, so that was out of question. And then… to spread salt on the wound… I dug out my gaming Windows laptop from 2018, installed Unity on it, optimistically tried the same thing, and… the Meta Quest Link app claimed that my graphics card was not good enough for it. Are you kidding me! And that laptop is not even that bad, it runs GTA V. No one told me I would need a top-notch Windows laptop to have an optimal experience in this course…

## Expo Preparation
Preparing for the expo was considerably stressful because of what I just mentioned: no one in our group was the owner of a powerful Windows laptop, and we could not, to save our lives, build directly to one of the headsets. So we struggled looooots, asked for laptops from our friends, and in the end, somehow made it playable for the headset we booked! I think the learning takeaway from this is that we should have tried building our project to the headsets sooner… and more regularly. But it was the result of all of us rarely setting foot on university grounds, and also the fact that the XR Lab was crazy crowded during Lab Hours… I’m not an anxious person but I couldn’t be in there at that time without going insane. So… I guess we just delayed all of that insanity to the weekend right before the expo, because although the lab was empty, we now had the pressure of making it work driving us nuts ahahah.

## Expo
Despite everything, showing our projects at the expo felt amazing. Kasper really liked our games, and everyone who tried them felt the same. I was even fortunate enough to be visited by a dear friend who doesn’t even go to VIA, and she loved them too!!! It was the build-up of all of our hard work: in the end, everything was fine and it paid off!! :))))

Not only that, but it was a pleasure to see everyone’s projects even if I didn’t get to play all of them. We had really talented groups in this semester for XRD - it was really inspiring to see how much commitment everyone put into their projects, especially since a big part of our class was from sixth semester so they hadn’t even had GMD before!! I have a lot of praise for them, I can’t imagine how much of an added challenge it is to figure out the AR/VR stuff when it is YOUR FIRST TIME FACING UNITY. Mad respect.

Well, to wrap it up… I want to say that XRD and GMD are some of the most inspiring and empowering courses for VIA students to create amazing experiences :)). I am grateful to have had access to my lecturers’ guidance, the XR Lab and the high-end equipment to give VR development a shot!

If you’ve made it this far, thanks a lot for reading through and see you when I see you :)!
