# How does XR add value to the end user?

It adds value by giving the user the sense of being present in the virtual world somehow, which can mean faster and, especially, more realistic interactions with the virtual elements at use. 

# How does current XR technology compare to an idealistic future vision of the technology?

We are limited by the current technology at use, which is improving but still faces some challenges like movement in virtual reality, eye problems, or the fact that nobody is going to realistically wear the currently existing VR glasses at all times. In an ideal future, XR will be able to help us at every moment in our lifes, whether we are at home and just need to see the time or weather for the day, or at work performing super complicated tasks with a virtual asistant helping us. We probably won't even need our phones anymore, with the help of XR we could take photos, write notes, send messages, receive help without even needing to ask for it, and everything in real time. The possibilities are endless, but a lot of progress is still required to get there.

# How does immersion and presence factor into XR?

Is one of the best features of XR and the one that makes it stands out from normal videogames, web applications, movies, and any other technology. Instead of feeling like you are seeing a different world, the user can now feel like he is inside of it. If you are immerse in the virtual reality, you can forget about the real world around you and focus entirely on the virtual experience. This also means that you should be careful with the environment in which you immerse yourself, as you could be present to dangers without realizing if you do it, for example, next to a road with ongoing traffic, close to a staircase, or in general in a room with a lot of furniture you could crash into.

But achieving immersion in XR does not come without challenges - for example, when interacting with objects in the virtual space, we do not feel their weight - or, when we move "in-game", we sometimes do not move in real life, and this can impact the experience. It is also possible to enter a state of motion sickness when using the equipment, which feels bad, but it should be improved in the future when the equipment is improved.
