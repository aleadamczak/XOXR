# How is input technology and interactions different in XR?
### Mobile XR
When it comes to Mobile XR, the input technology is the camera (and maybe the sensors) of the device. We see the digital reality on the screen and also interact with it through the screen, most of the time. So the main difference with how we usually do things is that we have to point our camera at something in order to "augment" it with our phone (AR), or to "see the virtual reality" through our phone camera & screen (VR).

### Headset XR
When it comes to experiencing XR through the headset, though, is when things become even more different than the digital interactions we're used to. Most of our digital interactions are usually with screens. But now, the screen sits right before our eyes, and our way of interacting with it can take a multitude of forms - all the way from body movement itself, a console controller, a XR-specific controller, or maybe even something very specific to the software we're using, like a steering wheel with brakes. So interactions with the headset are not only very different from our usual digital interactions, but they are also very varied in nature! 

# What problems can XR solve?
As mentioned in the lecture, XR can save a lot of time and money! The first thing that comes to mind is the situations when expertise is needed, or when people need to gather - because instead of flying them around the world, which results in a crazy amount of emissions, it is often possible to just have an XR-enhanced call with them! One example is a technician giving instructions to just about anyone from afar, while other is, for example, a work meeting or a lecture where people cannot meet in person but rather online, and the XR-enhanced call can provide a closer experience than a mere voice call. Another example would be for trainings - instead of introducing people to the real-world scenarios, where there might be pressure to do things right the first time and very little room for failure, it is possible to first introduce them to trainings in a virtual simulated reality, where they can acquire confidence and familiarity with the systems they need to use. A great example of this is pilot trainings, where you maybe don't want to put a plane at risk, and even, if you take it a step further, for training astrounats.
